          I have always done well in my courses at the university where I
          maintain a GPA of 3.0/4.0. Moreover, after the completion of several
          courses connected to my major, I felt myself more comfortable in the
          communication and software parts, and I enjoyed learning and applying
          their concepts. Also, I have performed several lab experiments and
          designed a variety of projects that drove my knowledge and
          understanding to new heights. Furthermore, I have attended several
          workshops and webinars that played a huge role in elivating my
          experience and knowledge.

          I am believed to be a very hardworking and determined individual who
          thrives to be the best at what they do. Also, I tend to achieve almost
          everything I set my mind to, and I have the ability to work under
          pressure and finish tasks during the specified time. Being a tutor for
          almost five years now, I can be very patient, and I maintain excellent
          communication skills. Further, I always tend to find solutions to
          problems I face whenever working on a certain project.
